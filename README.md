# Multi-class version of block graph generator
Version of the [block graph generator](https://github.com/mlai-bonn/BlockGraphGenerator) that can produce datasets with more than two classes.

## Usage

The script produces output in the file format that is used by the [TUDataset](https://chrsmrrs.github.io/datasets/).

Use it on the command line with the following arguments

	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
	  --name NAME  Name of output file(s)
	  --N N        Number of graphs per class
	  --Nc Nc      Number of classes
	  --n N        Number of blocks
	  --c C        Size of blocks
	  --p P        Edge probability
	  --m M        Number of noise edges
	  --seed SEED  Random seed

Note that for certain parameter combinations, the script might not terminate.

# Original description:
# Stochastic Block Model Graphs

We consider graphs generated by the stochastic block model (Wang and Wong, 1987). 
The specific generation of graphs is described by the following process:
Let $T$ be some random tree of a predefined size.
Create two (non-isomorphic) graphs $G_1,G_2$ by adding a new edge to $T$.
To ensure that the classification task is non-trivial, we require that $G_1$ and $G_2$ have the same multiset of vertex degrees.
We then generate a set of graphs for each $G \in G_1,G_2$ by repeating the following process:

1. Let $\widehat{G}$ be the empty graph.
1. For each $v \in G$, add a set of $c$ vertices $v_1,...,v_c$ to $\widehat{G}$.
2. For each $v \in G$, connect pairs $\{v_i,v_j\} \in V(\widehat{G})$ by an edge with probability $p$.
3. For all pairs $\{v_i,u_j\} \in V(\widehat{G})$ with $\{v,u\} \in E(G)$, connect them by an edge with probability $p$, as well.
4. Connect a number of $m_x$ prior unconnected vertex pairs $\{v_i,u_j\}$ in $\widehat{G}$ as noise edges. 

The resulting classification task is to assign the generated graph $\widehat{G}$ to the underlying graph structure $G \in G_1,G_2$. 
The figure depicts an example of two such generated graphs.  

![Graphs generated by slightly different underlying structures (depicted in grey). Each block in the
underlying structure contains 3 vertices. Two vertices are connected by an edge with some probability p if
they belong to the same block or their blocks are connected in the underlying structure (depicted by solid
black lines). Furthermore, both graphs additionally contain mx = 4 noise edges (depicted by dashed red
lines)](blockgraphs.png)

All datasets considered in the evaluation of (Schulz et al., 2022) were created starting with a random tree of size $16$ which was extended by a single random edge resulting in graphs $G_1,G_2$.
For each classification task we generated $200$ random graphs for each $G \in G_1,G_2$. 
The number of vertices $c$ contained in a block was set to $8$ in all experiments. 
For each set of parameter choices, we generated $5$ datasets and provide the mean accuracy.
